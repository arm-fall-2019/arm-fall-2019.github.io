# Posting to the Course Blog

Posting to the course blog is fairly straightforward, as it is an point-and-click process. Before attempting to post, follow instructions to create your blog at https://github.com/arm-fall-2019/arm/fall-2019.github.io/blob/master/instructions/course-blog.md if you haven't done so already.

1. Log into the site by going to https://arm-fall-2019.matthew-lavin.com and clicking "login"
2. Enter your Github username and password if prompted and accept the terms of use
3. Click the link titled "Admin" and, under the student content submenu, click the link titled "Blog Post"
4. Fill out all required fields, including your post in the "Body" field. (You can also click "source" to enter pure HTML if you happen to prefer it.)
5. Under tags, click the text box. A list of available tags will appear. Choose the "Introductions" tag from the list
6. When you are finished writing, click "save" and go to your blog to verify that your post is now published.
